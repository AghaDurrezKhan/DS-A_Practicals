        "\n",
        "In machine learning we use large amounts of data to train our models. Some machine learning algorithms may require that the data is *normalized* in order to work correctly. The idea of normalization, also known as *feature scaling*, is to ensure that all the data is on a similar scale, *i.e.* that all the data takes on a similar range of values. For example, we might have a dataset that has values between 0 and 5,000. By normalizing the data we can make the range of values be between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will be performing a different kind of feature scaling known as *mean normalization*. Mean normalization will scale the data, but instead of making the values be between 0 and 1, it will distribute the values evenly in some small interval around zero. For example, if we have a dataset that has values between 0 and 5,000, after mean normalization the range of values will be distributed in some small range around 0, for example between -3 to 3. Because the range of values are distributed evenly around zero, this guarantees that the average (mean) of all elements will be zero. Therefore, when you perform *mean normalization* your data will not only be scaled but it will also have an average of zero.\n",
